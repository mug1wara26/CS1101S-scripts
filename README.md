# CS1101S scripts

A collection of scripts I made for fun for the NUS Mod CS1101S. This module uses
a [restricted subset of JavaScript](https://github.com/source-academy/js-slang)
which provides some fun challenges.

## Scripts

You can play with the scripts by clicking on them below

* [bf.js](https://share.sourceacademy.org/0ga1y): BrainFuck in source3, probably
has issues, is improved on in the source1 version. Set execution time to a big
number so that it does not time out.
* [bf_source1.js](https://share.sourceacademy.org/7tnrj): BrainFuck in source1.
Once again, set execution time to a big number.
* [rickroll_token_optimized.js](https://share.sourceacademy.org/7ue6a): There was
a contest to play some music using the
[sounds](https://source-academy.github.io/modules/documentation/modules/sound.html)
module, a higher token count would decrease your max possible score, so I made my
code as short as possible.
You will have to include `import { play, consecutively, cello } from 'sounds';`
at the top of the program.
